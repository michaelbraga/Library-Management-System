# Library Management System
### Dependencies
1.	NodeJS (w/ recent npm)
	* [NodeJS by Installer](https://nodejs.org/en) (best)
	* [NodeJS by Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
2.	Web Browser
	* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - HTML 5
	* not preferable for other browsers, since most functionalities will not be responsive
3.	Grunt (for development only)
	* this will be primarily used for running the server for traces
4.	PostgreSQL
